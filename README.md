# Hi there, I'm Warrior, an aspiring programmer!

I've been learning how to code since 2020. Since then, I've changed my vision as a programmer a lot. I went from wanting to use JavaScript (and JavaScript alone), to Python, to C++, to Rust, until finally deciding on C# since that is what I'm the most comfortable with. Its syntax isn't too complex/overwhelming (like C++), it's statically typed (unlike Python and JavaScript) and doesn't have that many weird quirks that I had to learn as a beginner (unlike Rust).
